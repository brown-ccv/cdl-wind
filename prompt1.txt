You will be provided with a folder of images. For each image in the folder, analyze the image and answer the following questions. Present the results as a JSON-like string that can be easily parsed as a Python dictionary. The dictionary MUST have the following structure:

*   The key "Image ID" MUST contain the image file name.
*   The remaining keys MUST be the question numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).
*   The values MUST be the answers to the corresponding questions.

Under NO circumstances should you include any introductory or explanatory text. Only provide the JSON-like string. If you cannot answer a question based on the image, respond with "Cannot determine from image".

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: JSON String Formatting**

When generating the JSON-like string, you **MUST** follow these rules precisely:

1.  **Escape Double Quotes:** Any double quote characters (`"`) within the text values **MUST** be escaped using a single backslash (`\`). This means a double quote should be represented as `\"`.
2.  **Escape Single Quotes:** Any single quote characters (`'`) within the text values **MUST** be escaped using a single backslash (`\`). This means a single quote should be represented as `\'`.
3.  **No Unescaped Quotes:** **DO NOT** include any unescaped double quotes or single quotes within the text values.
4.  **Handle Newlines as Spaces:** If there are newlines in the text, replace them with a single space. **DO NOT** use `\n` or any other escape sequence for newlines.
5.  **No Extra Spaces:** Do not include any extra spaces before or after the values.
6.  **Do Not Replace Single Quotes with Double Quotes:** If there is a single quote in the text, it should remain a single quote, and it should be escaped. **Specifically, words like "get'em" MUST be represented as "get\'em"**.

**Examples of Correct Escaping and Formatting:**

*   **Correct:** `"This is a \"quoted\" string."` (Double quotes escaped)
*   **Correct:** `"It\'s a \'single quoted\' string."` (Single quotes escaped)
*   **Correct:** `"The user said, \"Hello there!\" and then, \"Goodbye!\""` (Multiple double quotes escaped)
*   **Correct:** `"This string has a newline: Like this."` (Newline replaced with a space)
*   **Correct:** `"Go get\'em"` (Single quote escaped - **THIS IS CRUCIAL**)
*   **Correct:** `"This is a string with \"quotes\" and a single quote \' in it."`
*   **Correct:** `"Here's another example with a single quote: Don\'t do that."`
*   **Incorrect:** `"This is a "quoted" string."` (Unescaped double quote)
*   **Incorrect:** `"It's a 'single quoted' string."` (Unescaped single quote)
*   **Incorrect:** `"This string has a newline:\\nLike this."` (Incorrect newline representation)
*   **Incorrect:** `"Go get\"em"` (Single quote replaced with double quote - **THIS IS WRONG**)
*   **Incorrect:** `" This is a string with extra spaces. "` (Extra spaces)
*   **Incorrect:** `"This string has a newline:\nLike this."` (Newline not replaced with a space)

**Example of Correct Output:**
