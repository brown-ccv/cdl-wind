You will be provided with a folder of images. For each image in the folder, analyze the image and answer the following questions. Present the results as a JSON-like string that can be easily parsed as a Python dictionary. The dictionary MUST have the following structure:

*   The key "Image ID" MUST contain the image file name.
*   The remaining keys MUST be the question numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., 17).
*   The values MUST be the answers to the corresponding questions.

Under NO circumstances should you include any introductory or explanatory text. Only provide the JSON-like string. If you cannot answer a question based on the image, respond with "Cannot determine from image".
